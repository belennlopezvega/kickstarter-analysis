# Kickstarter Analysis
## Overview of Project  
### The purpose of this analysis is to assist Louise in analyzing data surrounding theater campaigns and their fundraising goals. Louise's play came close to it's fundraising goals so she's interested in seeing how different campaigns' launch dates and funding goals went about. The findings and data presented below will show a clear picture as to when it is best to launch campaigns, and what fundraising goals prove to have a high success rate. Alternatively, it will also show when it's the worst time to launch a campaign, and what fundraising goals have a lower success rate. This will assist Louise in making any future decisions if she choose to put on another play in the future. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The table above shows the data gathered comparing the successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns based on their launch date. In general, there was a peak of theater campaigns launched in the summer months with May and June coming in as the highest. In particular, May holds the highest number of campaigns launched at a total of 166, and both the highest number of successful and failed campaigns at 111 and 52, respectfully. June comes in close behind May as the second month of overall launched theater campaigns with the second most successful amount. In contrast, the winter month data shows the least amount of overall launched theater campaigns with December at the bottom with 35 campaigns launched. The winter months also show the least amount of successful campaigns, almost totaling the same amount of failed campaigns in December with 37 successful and 35 failed. When it comes to canceled theater campaigns, throughout the year the average is at 3 except for in January and October where there were 7 and 0 canceled campaigns, respectfully. The amount of canceled campaigns compared to the amount of successful and failed campaigns is quite large as most campaigns were carried out until their end. Overall, when it comes to the outcomes based on launch date, the date does have a significance as May and June show the most launched campaigns with the most success rate. Respectfully, those two months also show the highest number of failed campaigns but between the rate of success and rate of failure within those months, there are more successful campaigns percentage wise, than failed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The table above shows outcomes of successful and failed plays based on their funding goal amount. The plays with a goal of Less than $1000 and up to $14,999 showed the most amount of successful projects and overall projects, with projects with a goal of less than $1,000 at a success rate of 76% where there were a total of 186 projects. Specfifically, there were the most projects in the goal of $1,000 to $4,999 where there was a total of 534. Out of those, 388 were successful which comes out to a 73% success rate.  As the goals increase, so do the chances of having a project fail. The projects were all showing a success rate higher of 50% until the goal of $15,000 to $19,999 where the amount of successful and failed projects came to 50% each. After that, most of the goals start showing higher percentages of failed projects compared to successful ones. There are two cases within those named ranges where the success rate is higher than the failed rate and that is at the goals $35,000 to $39,999 and $40,000 to $44,999 where the success rate is 66% within those two goals. It's also important to note that between $25,000 and $49,999 the amount of projects also goes significantly down with the most being 11 projects with the goal $30,000 to $34,000, and there being only 1 project at the goal $45,000 to $49,999. This shows that the higher the goal is, the least amount of projects there are. However, there is one outlier as the goals increase within the data. There are 16 projects with a goal Greater than $50,000. In that category the success rate is 12.5% and failure rate is 87.5%. Overall, the data and graph above shows that the higher the goal is, the more likely it is for the project to fail. Consequently, the lower the goal is, the more likely it is to have a higher success rate as the goals within the range Less than $1,000 and up tp $14,999 seemed to have success rates higher than 50%. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The data sets above prove easy to understand but there are some potential challenges that could easily be fixed. For starters, in the Outcomes Based on Launch Date Analysis, it would be beneficial to show the percentage of successful, failed and canceled kickstarters compared to the total to see how big those differences are. The graph itself adequately displays that information but to have those numbers would make it easier to understand the data and make further recommendations. As for the Outcomes Based on Goals Analysis there weren't many challenges, however there could be a difficulty when it comes to the outliers. There are two main outliers, one being the higher success rate later on as the goal got higher. In the graph, it makes it seem like there is a good likelihood that within that specific $35,000 to $44,999 range there is a possibility for a high success rate, but there were only 9 projects within that range which is a small number compared to the number of projects with lesser goals. The other outlier being the high number of projects with a goal Greather than $50,000 but with any number greater than $50,000 included in that goal, there are bound to be projects looking at that range thus making this outlier less significant. 

## Results

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data shown in the Outcomes Based on Launch Date graph above concludes that not only where there more campaigns launched in the summer months, focusing on May and June specifically, but that the chances of those campaigns being successful are equally as high. Secondly, the winter months prove to be the worst months to launch a campaign as the chances of that campaign failing are significantly higher than in the summer. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals 
Based on data shown in the Outcomes Based on Goals graph, we can conclude that generally the lower the fundraising goal is, the higher the chances of that project being successful is. Alternatively, the higher the goal is, the higher is the likelyhood of the project to fail is. 

### Summary of Limitations
As far as limitations, there weren't many presented in this analysis. One potential limitation could be the sample size in both graphs. The sample in the Outcomes based on Launch Date was that of 1,369. There was still a clear trend but a larger data set could have possibly shown higher discrepancies. As for the Outcomes Based on Goals, there were a lot of projects from which data was gathered and they only seem to go down as the goal rose. Had there been more projects, it's likely we would've still come to the same conclusion. 

### Additional Graphs
A graph that could have been insightful to include in this analysis is seeing how long campaigns ran. This information could lead Louise to better gage the duration of any future campaings, and their likelihood to meet their goal in a set amount of time. It could also show trends in how likely campaigns with higher goals versus lower goals are able to meet their goals and possibly create an understanding as to why campaigns fail at their goals.
