The table above shows the data gathered comparing the successful, failed, and canceled theater kickstarters based on their launch date. In general, there was a peak of theater kickstarters launched in the summer months with May and June coming in as the highest. In particular, May holds the highest number of kickstarters launched at a total of 166, and both the highest number of successful and failed kickstarters at 111 and 52, respectfully. June comes in close behind May as the second month of overall launched theater kickstarters with the second most successful amount. In contrast, the winter month data shows the least amount of overall launched theater kickstarters with December at the bottom with 35 kickstarters launched. The winter months also show the least amount of successful kickstarters, almost totaling the same amount of failed kickstarters in December with 37 successful and 35 failed. When it comes to canceled theater kickstarters, throughout the year the average is at 3 except for in January and October where there were 7 and 0 canceled kickstarters, respectfully. The amount of canceled kickstarters compared to the amount of successful and failed kickstarters is quite large as most kickstarters were carried out until their end. Overall, when it comes to the outcomes based on launch date, the date does have a significance as May and June show the most launched kickstarters with the most success rate. Respectfully, those two months also show the highest number of failed kickstarters but between the rate of success and rate of failure within those months, there are more successful kickstarters percentage wise, than failed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![This is an image](https://github.com/belennlopezvega/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

The table above shows outcomes of successful and failed plays based on their funding goal amount. The plays with a goal of Less than $1000 and up to $14,999 showed the most amount of successful projects and overall projects, with projects with a goal of less than $1,000 at a success rate of 76% where there were a total of 186 projects. Specfifically, there were the most projects in the goal range of $1,000 to $4,999 where there was a total of 534. Out of those, 388 were successful which comes out to a 73% success rate.  As the goals increase, so do the chances of having a project fail. The projects were all showing a success rate higher to 50% until the goal of $15,000 to $19,999 where the amount of successful and failed projects came to 50% each. After that, most of the goals start showing higher percentages of failed projects compared to successful ones. There are two cases within those named ranges where the success rate is higher than the failed rate and that is at the goals $35,000 to $39,999 and $40,000 to $44,999 where the success rate is 66% within those two goals. It's also important to note that between $25,000 and $49,999 the amount of projects also goes significantly down with the most being 11 projects with the goal $30,000 to $34,000, and there being only 1 project at the goal $45,000 to $49,999. This shows that the higher the goal is, the least amount of projects there are. However, there is one outlier as the goals increase wihtin the data. There are 16 projects with a goal Greater than $50,000. In that category the success rate is 12.5% and failure rate is 87.5%. Overall, the data and graph above shows that the higher the goal is, the more likely it is for the project to fail. Consequently, the lower the goal is, the more likely it is to have a higher success rate as the goals within the range Less than $1,000 and up tp $14,999 seemed to have success rates higher than 50%.
